# Soundboard App

## Description
This repo contains my submission for the Soundboard Android Application.

## Assignment

A soundboard is a program, web application, mobile app or other application that play many short soundbites or audio clips.  Soundboards are self-contained and typically based on a theme. 

Here is an example of a web application soundboard: http://www.realmofdarkness.net/pc/soundboards (Links to an external site.)

In this week's assignment, you will create a soundboard application. You will need to come up with a theme for your soundboard and collect audio files and clips from royalty-free sources. Using what you have learned about multimedia in this lesson, create at least 9 soundbites that can be played through your app on command. 

Be prepared to present your project in class Monday
